# Project: Words 4 Music

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

The programs that I used in this project are the following:

1. Clustering
2. Topic Modeling
  
Clustering algothrim program looks at words and lyrics clusters that are similar to each other and to rank these music accordingly. I will then use these algorithms to rank the music predictions/associations.
